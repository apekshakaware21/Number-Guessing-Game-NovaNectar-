# üéÆ Number Guessing Game ‚Äì Python Tkinter GUI

## üß† Project Overview

The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple and fun desktop application developed using **Python's Tkinter GUI library**. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to input guesses via a graphical interface. The application provides real-time feedback on whether the guess is **too high**, **too low**, or **correct**, encouraging the user to keep guessing until they win. A **reset** button is also provided to restart the game at any time.

This project is perfect for beginners looking to explore GUI development with Python while implementing logical control structures and user interactions.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Duration Taken to Complete the Project

- **Planning & Design:** 30 minutes
- **Development:** 1 hour
- **Testing & Debugging:** 30 minutes
- **Total Time:** **2 hours**

---

## üèÅ Outcome

- Successfully created a fully functional number guessing game using Tkinter.
- Enhanced understanding of GUI components like labels, buttons, and input fields.
- Implemented input validation and game logic using conditional statements.
- Developed a user-friendly experience with visual feedback and a reset feature.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **Input Validation:** Ensuring that only valid integers between 1 and 100 were accepted without crashing the program.
- **User Feedback:** Designing meaningful and real-time responses for each type of guess (too low, too high, correct).
- **GUI Layout Management:** Properly aligning components to maintain a clean and intuitive layout.
- **Random Number Reset:** Resetting the game logic without restarting the entire application.
